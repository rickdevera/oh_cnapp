# Hands-On Lab Guide: Testing Tenable Cloud Security CSPM in AWS Cloud Environment

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- Active AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your machine.
- Basic understanding of AWS services and security concepts.

## Steps  
## 1.   Setting Up Your AWS Environment

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console and log in with your credentials.  
1.  
1. **Create a new IAM Role for Tenable Cloud Security**:
   - Navigate to the IAM service.
   - Click on "Roles" then "Create role".
   - Select "AWS service" as the type of trusted entity and choose "Lambda" as the service that will use this role.
   - Click on "Next: Permissions" and attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy for testing purposes.
   - Name the role `TCSLambdaRole` and create it.

## Step 2: Deploying Tenable Cloud Security CSPM

1. **Sign Up for Tenable Cloud Security**:
   - If you haven’t already, sign up for an Tenable Cloud Security account by visiting their website and choosing a suitable plan.

1. **Integrate Tenable Cloud Security with AWS**:
   - In the Tenable Cloud Security dashboard, navigate to the integration section.
   - Select AWS as the cloud provider.
   - Follow the instructions to integrate Tenable Cloud Security with your AWS account. This typically involves providing access via the IAM role created earlier or by configuring a cross-account access role that Tenable Cloud Security can use to assess your environment.

## Step 3: Configuring Policies and Alerts

1. **Define Policies**:
   - In the Tenable Cloud Security dashboard, go to the policies section.
   - Create new policies or customize existing ones according to your organization's security requirements. Policies can be based on compliance standards, such as CIS AWS Foundations, or custom security best practices.

1. **Configure Alerts**:
   - Navigate to the alerts section.
   - Set up alerts for policy violations or suspicious activities detected by Tenable Cloud Security. Alerts can be configured to be sent via email, SMS, or integrated into third-party tools like Slack.

## Step 4: Running Security Assessments

1. **Initiate a Security Assessment**:
   - In the Tenable Cloud Security dashboard, find the section for security assessments.
   - Start a new assessment to analyze your AWS environment based on the configured policies.
   - Tenable Cloud Security will evaluate your environment’s security posture and provide a detailed report on findings, including misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and compliance violations.

1. **Review Findings and Recommendations**:
   - Once the assessment is complete, review the findings in the Tenable Cloud Security dashboard.
   - For each finding, Tenable Cloud Security provides detailed information and recommendations for mitigation.

## Step 5: Remediation and Continuous Monitoring

1. **Implement Remediation Actions**:
   - Based on Tenable Cloud Security’s recommendations, take necessary actions to remediate identified security issues. This might involve modifying IAM policies, securing S3 buckets, or updating security groups.

1. **Enable Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Configure Tenable Cloud Security for continuous monitoring of your AWS environment.
   - Continuous monitoring helps to detect and alert on security issues in real-time, ensuring ongoing compliance and security posture management.

## Conclusion

This hands-on lab guide provides a basic framework for testing Tenable Cloud Security CSPM in an AWS cloud environment. By following these steps, you can assess and enhance your cloud security posture, leveraging Tenable Cloud Security’s capabilities for comprehensive security and compliance management. Remember, security is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and adaptation to new threats and vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining a secure cloud environment.
