##### Dashboard Navigation

Having a clear understanding of your cloud posture means you can continuously monitor, validate, and remediate your corporate security policies and best practices.  Quickly identifying vulnerabilities, anomalies, configurations issues are a few of the key features in the Tenable Cloud Security Dashboard.

###### Login to the Tenable Cloud Security Dashboard

1.  `Login` into **https://us.app.ermetic.com**  *** (Instruction for credentials are found in the Prerequites section above) ***
1.  On the **Top-Right**, `select` **All accounts** drop down and `choose` **AWS->Production Labs->awsjams** under the **Organization** hierarchy. 

    <u>***Note:  This must be selected when completing all tasks in this challenge.  If not, there maybe different validation results.*** </u>


When you log into the Console, your Dashboard appears. The Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your cloud environment, giving you a snapshot of your asset count and security posture. Itâ€™s a great jumping off point for deeper investigation into potentially risky events and circumstances in your environment.  

The Dashboard can be used to:
  - Provide a quick, high-level overview of important activities for corporate executives.
  - Allow security professionals to easily monitor and remediate their security state by drilling down into relevant issues.
The various out-of-the-box widgets in the Dashboard highlight common security concerns such as excessive permissions, public resources, and compliance.

This lab will only focus on a few widgets on the dashboard.
Here is a <a href="https://docs.ermetic.com/docs/dashboard" rel="nofollow">link</a> that shows the dashboard and all the widgets.
