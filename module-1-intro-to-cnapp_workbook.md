#### Explanation of Dashboard Widgets

| **Dashboard Widgets** | **Description** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
|Organiziation View     | The top-left bar of the dashboard shows an overview of the connected accounts in each one of the cloud service provider (CSP) organizations. |
| Asset Inventory (Resources) |  Inventory (Resources)	The top-right bar of the dashboard shows a breakdown of assets in your environment by resource category. |
| Open Findings | See a high-level overview of open findings in Tenable Cloud Security. Findings represent at-risk identities and resources, including hard-to-spot toxic combinations. |
| Trends | Track the status of findings by viewing a snapshot of activity data over a set period of time. |
